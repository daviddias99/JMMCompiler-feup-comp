**Project: JMM Compiler**

* The tool built serves as a compiler of .jmm files, written in the Java-- language, a subset of the Java language. All programs that are valid in the Java-- language are also valid in the Java language. 
* The compiler generates files of the classes with JVM instructions accepted by jasmin, a tool that translates those classes in Java bytecodes (classfiles). The generated classes given Java-- code can be integrated in a Java application. Those classes can invoke Java methods previously compiled to bytecodes.
* The process of generating the instructions and the .j file from the .jmm file is divided in several phases: the compiler first performs a **lexical and syntactic analysis** to the code, matching tokens and expressions to check the validity of the code. This, among other things, generates the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the program. Next, a **semantic analysis** of the program is performed, catching some types of errors that could not be detected in the previous analysis. A **syntax table** is generated in this phase. Next, comes the **code generation** phase, where the compiler, based on the AST and symbol table previously created, generates the code for jasmin to interpret. This code will be stored in a .j file. The compiler also has implemented a series of **optimizations** that improve the quality of the code generated (ex: usage of **graph coloring** to reduce the ammount of registers needed) and the program that originates from it, as well as the overall performance of the compiler.
* Languages/technologies used: **Java, JavaCC, jasmin.**
* View the `jmm-compiler/java--handout.pdf` file for the specification of the assignment and `jmm-compiler/README.md` for a description of the features we implemented.
